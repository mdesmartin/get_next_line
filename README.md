# get_next_line

get_next_line is a function developed as part of the 42 school curriculum that allows reading a file or a file descriptor line by line. It provides a convenient way to retrieve the contents of a file incrementally without having to load the entire file into memory at once. The function showcases file I/O, memory management, and string manipulation.

The main objective of get_next_line is to read a file descriptor and return the next line of text each time the function is called. This enables efficient handling of large files or streams by processing them line by line rather than loading the entire content into memory.

## Key Features:

- Line-by-line reading: get_next_line reads a file descriptor and extracts the next line of text until the end of the file or an error occurs.
- Dynamic memory allocation: The function allocates memory as needed to store the read line, ensuring that the memory is released appropriately.
- Buffer management: get_next_line manages an internal buffer to efficiently read and process the file contents without unnecessary overhead.
- Compatibility: The function is designed to work with multiple file descriptors simultaneously, allowing for concurrent file processing.

*By working on get_next_line, you will gain practical experience in file I/O operations, memory management, and string manipulation. It provides a useful utility function that can be integrated into larger projects requiring line-by-line file processing.*

**Note:** This function was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a comprehensive file I/O library.
